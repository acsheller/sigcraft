# SignalCraft

SignalCraft is a hands-on learning and experimentation project for **GNU Radio**, **DSP**, and **RF signal processing**.  
It’s organized as a set of small, focused subprojects that can grow over time as new topics are explored.

## Structure

- **gnuradio_docker/** — A GNU Radio development environment in Docker (Ubuntu-based).
- **rocky_gnuradio_docker/** — GNU Radio environment built on Rocky Linux with XFCE desktop & VNC access.
- *(More subprojects coming soon...)*

## Goals

- Learn GNU Radio and DSP concepts step-by-step.
- Build reproducible development environments for RF experimentation.
- Keep the setup portable and easy to run anywhere.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/signalcraft.git
   cd signalcraft
